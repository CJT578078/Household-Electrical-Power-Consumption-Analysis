## Household Electrical Power Consumption Analysis

**Cameron Tsai**

### Executive summary


**Project overview and goals:**

The goal of this project is to identify trends in household electrical power usage to provide actionable insights for energy providers and support proactive grid maintenance. To achieve this, we will develop predictive models capable of estimating power consumption at any given time, helping utilities optimize power distribution and improve infrastructure planning.

Specifically, we will train and evaluate three regression models on household electrical power consumption data, comparing their performance to determine the most effective approach. In addition, we will develop a statistical time series model to enhance our understanding of temporal consumption patterns and forecast future usage.

An in-depth analysis of the dataset will be conducted to extract meaningful insights and trends. Finally, we will outline potential future work and improvements that could build upon the findings of this project.

#### Rationale

With the increasing demand on electrical grids, especially due to smart appliances and electric vehicles, efficient energy consumption forecasting has become critical. Accurate predictions allow energy providers to reduce waste, prevent blackouts, and plan for maintenance more effectively. This project supports these efforts by analyzing real household power usage and building models that capture its underlying patterns.


#### Research Question

Can we accurately predict household active power consumption based on time-related features (e.g., day of the week, time of day) and other variables such as voltage, current, and sub-metered energy use?

#### Data Sources

**Dataset**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption 

This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered in a house located in Sceaux (7km of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

**Cleaning and Preprocessing** 
The date and time are merged together to represent a specific moment that is inclusive of both date and time. Several columns of data which should be numerical were not and were thus converted. Redundant columns are dropped as well as any rows missing data.
